PassPhrase Version Alpha 1.2.5 03/27/2015

	General Usage
	-------------

-	This program is used to view password information for computer resources/services
	in a graphical format.
-	The user can add services to the program and all related information will be
	displayed in a tkinter tree widget.  Each service will have any optional related
	information displayed in columns.  This includes login name, password, and any
	relevent security question/answers.
-	The user can remove any uneeded services from the tree widget.
-	The information is stored in an encrypted pickle file when the program is not in
	use which, hopefully, protects sensitive password information. Each time the user
	saves the information she is queried for a cypher key.  She must then remember
	this key as it will be used to encrypt all password information. When the
	application starts it will look for this file and attempt to decrypt it, at which
	point the user will be queried for this key so that the decryption can be completed.


	Notes:
	------
	
	This is the first 'working' version of this program, but many featuers still need to
	be implemented.  I'm calling this alpha 1.0.  When all of the base featuers are complete
	I will call it Final Release version 1.0.
